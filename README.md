# Java-Quiz-App  (Collaborative Project by Paarth Asri and Priyanshu Mohta)

JavaQuiz App is a Java based quiz application built using AWT and Java Swing frameworks.

The application starts with a welcoming interface displaying the name of the quiz and an option to continue or exit.

The users are then prompted to enter their name followed by a rules page outlining the guidelines for the quiz.

The main quiz consists of several MCQ’s with a time management system. Each question is displayed on the screen and when the allotted time expires, the next question is automatically generated. Participants are required to select their answers within the given time frame.

Upon completion of the quiz, users are presented with a score window. The window includes a personalised thank-you message, the user’s score, and options to either play again or exit the application. The scores obtained by these users are stored in an SQL database for record keeping and future references.

JavaQuiz App offers an engaging and interactive platform for users to test their knowledge while providing a seamless user experience through its intuitive interface and efficient time management system.
